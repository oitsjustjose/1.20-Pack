# Harmonious Magineering Changelog

## v1.0.0-BETA8

### Added:

- Paxi
- New Framing Saw item textures
- New Sawmill item textures
- Silt -> 4x Silt Ball recipe

### Changed:

- Glass now requires a **Blast Furnace** rather than a _Normal Furnace_.
- Resource Packs are now being loaded by Paxi, meaning I no longer need to worry about file names changing, etc. and can more specifically control the resource pack loading order to have custom pack-specific resources take precedence over top of Brush-Up! and Brush-Up!++, etc..

### Fixed:

- Sodium Shader Incompatibility warning at each startup
- Beams are now craftable (as a result, 16 sticks can no longer be created from stripped logs)
- Stack names being reset when they shouldn't be (not usually applicable)
- Drawer Keys being gated _way_ too late in the game (sorry)
- Piglins should no longer drop arrows (I _did_ forget to test this to verify, but it should be fixed..)
- Mending _sometimes_ being obtainable from certain chest loot tables (specifically in the End as far as I can tell?). Now if you get it on a tool, the tool's enchantments will be wiped, and even if you somehow counteract that, Mending actually won't do anything to repair the tool anyways.

### Updated:

- Amendments
- Snow Real Magic
- Structure Essentals
- Many uninteresting library mods

## v1.0.0-BETA7:

### Added:
- Helpful tooltip to explain that some Aether tooltips are dungeon loot only

### Changed:
- Downgraded to NeoForge 47.1.99 so CurseForge support would be easier on me
- Farmer's Delight milk bottle recipe now yields 3 instead of 4 bottles. This is because _canonically_ a bottle of {fluid} is a **third** of a bucket, not a **fourth**. (Thanks Ellpeck for pointing this out - I couldn't unsee it)

### Fixed:

- Hopefully fixed the Xaero Coords not being disabled automatically - in my testing, this has been fixed...
- Changed T2 Blood Orb recipe to avoid conflicts
- None of my Miscellany recipes working (thanks auto-formatter for adding parentheses >_>)
- Quark's Framed Glass being able to be used in the recipe for Quark's Framed Glass (and JEI wanting to use it in making itself, causing an infinite and Iron-expensive loop)

## v1.0.0-BETA6:

### Updated:

- Amendments
- Delightful
- Embeddium

- Changed Barley actually balanced
- Cleaned up tooltips, possibly fixed the modname tooltip not working on servers ðŸ¤ž
- Made Post Boxes much easier to craft
- Removed main menu icons in the four corners
- Reverted changes to the Netherrack break/place sound (you're welcome Ellpeck)
- Created script to automatically disable Xaero's coordinate info display
    - This means your minimap settings won't reset each update anymore, but you'll be unable to use Xaero's Coordinate Display under the minimap (which is how I always intended the modpack to be played ðŸ˜‰)
